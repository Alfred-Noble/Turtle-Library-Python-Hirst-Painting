# Turtle-Library-Python-Hirst-Painting
Overview The Hirst Painting project is a Python application inspired by the famous artist Damien Hirst. It generates beautiful, dot-style paintings programmatically. This project demonstrates the use of Python's Turtle graphics module.

It showcases effective modular programming by splitting the functionality into two main files: main.py and hirst.py.

Features
1) Artistic Design: Automatically generate paintings with a unique, dot-based aesthetic similar to Damien Hirst's signature style.
2) Modular Structure: The project is divided into two main modules for better organization and maintainability.
3) Color Management: A variety of colors are used to create vibrant and visually appealing paintings.
4) Randomized Patterns: Each painting is generated with a degree of randomness, ensuring that no two paintings are exactly the same.
5) Customizable Settings: Easily adjust the size, spacing, and color palette of the dots to create different styles of paintings.

Files and Structure
1) main.py: This file contains the main script that initializes the painting process and interacts with the user. It serves as the entry point for the application.
2) hirst.py: This module encapsulates the core functionality for generating the Hirst-style paintings, including setting up the Turtle environment, defining the color palette, and creating the dot patterns.
